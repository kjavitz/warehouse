Because of a bad design by Magento which doesn't send quote item for function checkQuoteItemQty we have to rewrite:
ITwebexperts_PPRWarehouse_Model_CatalogInventory_Stock_Item::checkQuoteItemQty to add that as a parameter so in cocnlsuion we need to update all the places were is used:

ITwebexperts_PPRWarehouse_Model_Sales_Quote_Item::checkQty
ITwebexperts_PPRWarehouse_Model_CatalogInventory_Observer::checkQuoteItemQtyWithOptions
ITwebexperts_PPRWarehouse_Model_CatalogInventory_Observer::checkQuoteItemQtyWithoutOptions
